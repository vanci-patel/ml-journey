# Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured journey into Machine Learning, focusing on strong fundamentals, clean implementations, and practical understanding.

## Topics Covered
- Python for ML
- Linear Regression (from scratch & using scikit-learn)
- Logistic Regression (classification)
- Train-test split and data leakage
- Feature scaling and regularization
- Evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Unsupervised learning: K-Means clustering
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA
- End-to-end ML pipelines

## Structure
- `notebooks/` → ML implementations and experiments  
- `notes/` → Conceptual explanations and summaries  

## Upcoming
- End-to-end ML mini projects
- Model selection & hyperparameter tuning
- Applied ML workflows

This repository will evolve as I progress.
